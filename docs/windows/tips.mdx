# How to use windows effectively

A big goal of mine is to have keybinds for as much as possible. This is mainly beacuse it's more fun but also feels a lot smoother to work with.

## TLDR of keybinds:
- [windows+(ctrl)+1,2,3,4,...] = focus/open application in the order of the taskbar, keep some applications unpinned so you have some keys for random one-time programs.
- [windows+arrow, windows+shift+arrow] = snap application to different part of the screen or move applications between screens.


## Window management

- Pin common applications to taskbard in specific order.
Personally I have pinned items in the following order (as of writing this).

1. Terminal [windows+1]
2. Browser [windows+2]
3. Explorer [windows+3]
4. Discord [windows+4]
5. Slack [windows+5]
6. Youtube Music [windows+6]

I try to keep only the first 5-6 applications pinned but the main idea is to have some spare binds (out of 10) so when you open something you don't have pinned you know right away that it's for example [windows+6].

In my keyboard setup I personally have [keymaps](https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/OyXWa/latest/0) that does [wihndows+ctrl+[number]] so I can tap a key instead of holding down [windows].


### Window placement

This is the more basic keymaps of [windows+arrow] for snapping the size or [windows+shift+arrow] for moving applications between monitors.
