# Linux commands in Windows

A full table of all the commands needed to be effecient in the terminal for windows.

This list will ignore simple commands for now, such as `cd`. These commands can be used in the new terminal as is.

Note: This needs to use the new windows terminal (Powershell) and doesn't work with Command Prompt.

Linux | Windows

`grep` | `findstr`
`cat` | `type`
`touch` | `cd . >`
`which` | `gcm` 
`find . -name *.zip` | `ls . -Filter *.zip -Recurse`
