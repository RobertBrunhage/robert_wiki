# How to use windows effectively

A big goal of mine is to have keybinds for as much as possible. This is mainly beacuse it's more fun but also feels a lot smoother to work with.

## TLDR of keybinds:
[windows+1,2,3,4,...] = focus/open application in the order of the taskbar
[alt+tab, alt+shift+tab] = cycle between applications (trying to do the above more).


## Window management

- Pin common applications to taskbard in specific order.
Personally I have pinned items in the following order (as of writing this).

1. Terminal [windows+1]
2. Browser [windows+2]
3. Explorer [windows+3]

For other applications that are more sporadic (games etc) I simply do [alt+tab].
